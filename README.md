- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rainforestnomad
- 👀 I’m interested in 3d printers and computers, amongst other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently rebuilding my Ender 3 in to a Switchwire conversion, or, the EnderWire.
- I'm also learning 3d cad modelling in Fusion 360. Its a slow process, but I'm improving!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on spreading knowledge of 3d printing.
